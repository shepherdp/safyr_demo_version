a = 1
print(a)

a = "abc"
print(a)

a -= 'b'
print(a)

int b = 7   ; this variable is static
b = 6       ; if you try to change b to a non-number, you'll throw an error

.add [x y] <~ x + y      ; this is a one-line function

c = add(12 24)
print(c)

.sub [t u] <~            ; this is a multiline function
  return t - u           ; gonna use {} syntax, but I haven't changed that yet
end

q = sub(50 25)
print(q)
